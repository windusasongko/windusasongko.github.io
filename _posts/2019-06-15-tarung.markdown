***Tarung, berkelahi.***

Orang-orang gila, eksentrik, blak-blakan, nerd, diluar jalur, atau tidak jelas cenderung lebih saya sukai untuk dijadikan sahabat. I'll tell you why, but before that, fuck grammar, i don't care.

For me, It's easier to interact with those people. Because we mostly talk about shitty, light unimportant things like hentai recommendations, weirdly funny shitpost on instagram and facebook, or some nerdy techy stuffs like a new coding language. But that's just the tip of the fuckin' iceberg of shit talks we had.

The thing is, those talks made us(well, me) happier. 
It works, man. 
It fuckin' helps to relieve the pain.

Let me tell you something. 
Sometimes, a simple "How are you?" could destroy a person.

There's people who chose to throw all those anxiety, burden, or stacked pain to the back of their head, hide them all, and then seek for any source of happiness. 

And when they're triggered to remember all of it, well, they're fucked.

Most of the times, i'm one of them.

Sometimes i wish i never be born, because it would be much more easier than killing myself.

It doesn't mean that i'm suicidal though.
